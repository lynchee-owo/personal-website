Fuji-Web is an intelligent AI partner that understands the user’s intent, navigates websites autonomously, and executes tasks on the user’s behalf while explaining each action step. With Fuji-Web, we are able to demonstrate how our multi-modal parsing and annotation scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance (see ). It harnesses vision, DOM awareness, and semantic HTML understanding to focus on essential webpage elements while filtering out noise. This, combined with a “Prior Knowledge Augmentation” knowledge graph that encodes a high-level understanding of websites based on past experiences, allows Fuji-Web to function like an expert assistant with a guidebook for each site.
